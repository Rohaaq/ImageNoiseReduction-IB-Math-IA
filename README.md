### What is the IB AA Math IA?

The IB Analysis and Approaches (AA) Math Internal Assessment (IA) is a project where students explore a mathematical topic of their choice in depth. It assesses their ability to apply mathematical techniques and reasoning, and to present their findings in a written report.

### Title

**Seeing Through the Noise: An Exploration of Image Based Noise Reduction**

### Overview

For my math IA, I looked into convolution (can learn more about that [here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KuXjwB4LzSA)) and various noise reduction algorithms that rely on it to reduce noise in photos. I investigated how median filtering, mean filtering, non-local mean filtering, and Gaussian filtering work. After discovering that OpenCV has a library dedicated to these algorithms, I wrote my own code to apply them to a photo and compared their performance. 

The code I rote for these algorithms can be viewed in the repository.


### Motivation

I'm really interested in photography and used to be a purist about digital media. For any art form—be it portraits, visual art, or music—I always preferred it to be as true to life as possible. I viewed editing as "cheating," straying too far from the natural material. This belief extended to photography and influenced my initial view of photo editing. However, my opinions changed when I saw Canadian photographer Simon D'entrmant casually recommending noise reduction in Adobe Lightroom. This prompted me to take photo editing seriously and sparked my curiosity about the mathematical algorithms behind noise reduction. I wanted to understand how these algorithms work, their effectiveness, and how they impact the credibility of photo editing.

This investigation highlighted that advanced post-processing techniques are not just gimmicks but valuable advancements. They enhance photographic practice and creativity, demonstrating the significant contributions of mathematicians and computer scientists to the field.
